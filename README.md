## About the project

WIP

## Getting started

Require the project:
```BASH
composer require openauthdev/socialiteopenauthprovider
```

Ready! Now you can start with your project.

## Configuration

First of all replace the service provider `Laravel\Socialite\SocialiteServiceProvider` in the `config\app.php` in `providers[]` with `\SocialiteProviders\Manager\ServiceProvider::class`.

Then we add the required event listener. Go to `app/Providers/EventServiceProvider` and add the following lines to the `listen[]` array.
```PHP
\SocialiteProviders\Manager\SocialiteWasCalled::class => [
    'SocialiteProviders\\OpenAuth\\OpenAuthExtendSocialite@handle',
]
```

Finally, we just need to add the configuration instructions. To do this, add the following to the `config/services.php' file.
```PHP
'openauth' => [
    'client_id' => env('OPENAUTH_CLIENT_ID'),
    'client_secret' => env('OPENAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET'),
    'redirect' => env('OPENAUTH_REDIRECT_URI')
]
```

The configuration is now complete.

## Usage

Now you can use the OAuthProvider as usual with Sociallite.
```PHP
return Socialite::with('OPENAUTH')->redirect();
```
